## About Me
I am a data analyst with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. At BYU (Applied Statistics and Analytics), I developed my skills especially in R, SQL, and Tableau. I have 18 months of experience as a data analyst and visualization specialist at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, UT, where I manipulate data and perform statistical analyses in R, use SQL and Tableau together to create complex, interactive visualizations, and present analyses and dashboards to company stakeholders.

## Future Plans
I plan on getting a master's degree in Data Science.
